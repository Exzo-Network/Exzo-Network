### Hi there my name is Stefan and I'm a Bioinformatics Scientist, Data Scientist, and Self-taught Software Engineer with over 4+ years of experience in computational laboratories working on whole genomics sequencing projects, lung cancer squamous cell carcinoma therapeutic intervention projects, and other large dataset projects. I have been coding for over 7 years in different languages from Python, R programming, JavaScript, React JS. and many more.


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to integrate machine learning models into distributed ledgers to enhance the privacy and security of sensitive data.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to Whole Genomic Sequencing (WGS), data modeling, data interpretation, Web3 technology, and blockchain technology.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with building out complex solidity smart contract automation systems.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything science or data related.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy working on large datasets to utilize statistical modeling to interpret these results to come up with solutions to real world problems. I also really enjoy coffee and trying to make peoples lives better in anyway I can.
